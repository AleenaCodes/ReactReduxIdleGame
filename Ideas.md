Considerations

- Have things greyed out if can't afford?
- Express/node DB for leaderboard
  - When user clicks leaderboard add in own score, re-order database, and draw in top 10
  - When saving to local storage, also send to leaderboard?
- Set your own username
- Users have unique userid, but can set own username
  - Username displays on screen and on leaderboard
- Export save?

Notes -

See https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers section "Splitting Reducers" for how to split up reducers a bit more nicely

Left to do -

- Get add to leaderboard function passing a parameter - DONE
- Get add to leaderboard action working with form
- Get add to leaderboard action actually adding to db
- Check all leaderboard functionality
- Make and add all icons

If time -

- Things greyed out if can't afford
- Import/export save
